# Parcial1Web

### Description

### Motivation
This is a project for a [web development class](http://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_spring_2018/) in [Uniandes](https://www.uniandes.edu.co). The objective is to make a quick project using **MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and Node js**.

## Getting Started
For this proyect to run you will need a couple of things first. First of all, a package manager. I recommend [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for this project or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Once you have a package manager you can now download this repo on any folder you want on your computer.

## Deployment

### See an Already deployed demo

If you don't feel like deploying this project or preparing everythin listed on the *getting started* section, there is a deployed version of this project [LINK DE HEROKU.](PONER MI LINK DE HEROKU)

### Deploy Yourself
Once you have everything ready open the terminal on the root folder where this project is downloaded in your pc and then enter on the `frontend` folder and run:
* ```npm install```
* ```npm run build```

that way you will have the Reactjs front end application ready. Now, open a new terminal, go back to the main folder and run:
* ```npm install```
* ```npm start```

Then the node-express server will be up and running. Once you are finish with this you can open `localhost:3000` on your favorite browser and you will se the homepage of the app.
